This is a template for creating a web app to connect to your Puck.js from a browser. It's only been tested in Chrome Desktop and Chrome for Android.

This sample uses the following external libraries:

1. Twitter Bootstrap to make it pretty
2. jQuery 1.12.4
3. The Puck.js Web Bluetooth library

The application incorporates the capacitive sense capability, but you obviously don't have to use it.  Have fun!
